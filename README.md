Automatic Image Captioning

# Objective: 
Build an image captioning model to generate captions of an image using CNN

# Dataset Link: 
Flickr8k_dataset

# Dataset description: 
A collection of sentence-based image description
1. Dataset consists of 8k images in JPEG format with different shapes and sizes.
2. Images are paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the
salient entities and events.
3. The images were chosen from six different Flickr groups and included variety of
scenes and situations.

# Project Overview:
Captioning the images with proper description is a popular research area of Artificial
Intelligence. A good description of an image is often said as “Visualizing a picture in the
mind”. The generation of descriptions from the image is a challenging task that can help and
have a great impact in various applications such as usage in virtual assistants, image
indexing, recommendation in editing applications, help visually impaired persons and
several other natural language processing applications. In this project, we need to create a
multimodal neural network which involves the concept of computer vision and Natural
Language Process in recognizing the context of images and describe them in natural
languages (English, etc). Deploy the model and evaluate the model on 10 different real time
images.
